# [chartpy](https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy)

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/chartpy)](https://pepy.tech/project/chartpy)

chartpy creates a simple easy to use API to plot in a number of great Python chart libraries like plotly (via cufflinks), bokeh and matplotlib,
with a unified interface. You simply need to change a single keyword to change which chart engine to use (see below), rather than having
to learn the low level details of each library. I've also created new stylesheets and formating to ensure that the default matplotlib
styling looks more modern using Open Sans font.

*Contributors for the project are very much welcome, sell below!*

```
chart = Chart(df=df, chart_type='line', style=style)

# we now plot using multiple plotting libraries, with the same dataframe
chart.plot(engine='matplotlib')
chart.plot(engine='bokeh')
chart.plot(engine='plotly')
```

I had previously written the open source PyThalesians financial library. This new chartpy library has some similar functionality to the chart
part of that library. However, I've totally rewritten the API to make it much cleaner and easier to use. It is also now a fully
standalone package, so it'll be easier to use for both non-financial and financial applications. It also has many more features including subplots
and much more.

At present chartpy supports several types of plots
* line (bokeh, plotly and matplotlib)
* bar (bokeh, plotly and matplotlib)
* scatter (bokeh, plotly and matplotlib)
* bar horizontal (matplotlib and plotly)
* heatmap (matplotlib and plotly)
* surface (plotly)
* map plots (plotly)
* looking to add more (any requests?)

# VisPy

There is also very early support for line charts generated by [vispy](http://vispy.org/), which allows for GPU accelerated plotting in Python.
However, at present the wrapper doesn't yet support plotting of dates (these are ignored when plotting).

There is a big speed improvement in using the VisPy wrapper if you are plotting many millions of points (with a small number of points
matplotlib seems quicker). Installation instructions for VisPy are [here](http://vispy.org/installation.html). By default,
chartpy will install the latest release version, but you find it necessary to use the most up to date development version of VisPy

Other points to note
* Please bear in mind at present chartpy is currently a highly experimental alpha project and isn't yet fully
documented
* Uses Apache 2.0 licence

Do surface plots (plotly only at present - see examples/surface_examples.py)

Do bar horizontal plots (matplotlib and plotly - see examples/chart_demo.py)

Create HTML webpages (using Canvas class - see examples/canvas_demo.py) - using mixture of plots (plotly, bokeh & matplotlib), tables
and text, with just a few lines of Python! The HTML file can then be uploaded to a webserver for display (or sent around by e-mail etc)

# Requirements

Major requirements
* Required: Python 3.7
* Required: pandas, matplotlib, plotly, cufflinks, bokeh, numpy etc.

# To install Open Sans font

My chartpy stylesheet for matplotlib uses the free Open Sans font. For it to display properly you need to install Open Sans font
on your computer
* First download font from https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans
* Windows: Install font by dragging to Windows/fonts folder
* Windows: Reset matplotlib font cache (delete file eg. c:/users/username/.matplotlib/fontList.py3k.cache
* On Mac OS X/Linux procedure for installing fonts is different


# Installation

You can install the library using the below (latest version). After installation:
* Make sure you edit the chartconstants.py file for the correct Plotly API and Twitter API keys
(or create a chartcred.py file)

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy.git
```

You can also install chartpy from PyPI (but this will usually be a slightly older version)

```
pip install chartpy
```

# Why did I write chartpy?

There are many good charting libraries. However, they all have different APIs. It took me a lot of time to learn a new API,
for each new plotting library I wanted to use. I ended up writing chartpy to abstract away all this complexity, so I could
concentrate on analysing data, rather than getting caught up in complex API visualisation calls. Rather than
having to totally edit my code each time, a single keyword is enough to switch between for example plotly and matplotlib.

I've also tried to design the library so that adding a new plotting engine is fairly straightforward (extend EngineTemplate
and edit the get_engine method in Chart), so it's basically future proof for whatever new chart libraries come along, with
relatively small changes to your code base.

# Interactive Web Dashboards with chartpy/dash

chartpy also has interactive dashboards based on Plotly's Dash package, but with a lot less of the boilerplate code
which Dash uses. Users extend `LayoutCanvas` to create their own Dash layouts and `SketchComponents` can be used
to quickly create Dash components/HTML components, with relatively few lines of code.

Hence, it's a lot quicker to create Dash based dashboards in chartpy! In the future, we want
to also support other Python dashboards like [H2O Wave](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-wave/).

You'll need to install Dash as an extra
to use them as they aren't part of the default installation, which we can see below (Linux at top, Windows on bottom)
although it does work with later versions too:

    pip install plotly==4.14.3 kaleido dash==1.20.0 \
      dash-html-components==1.1.3 dash-core-components==1.16.0 dash-table==4.11.3 \
      jupyter-dash==0.4.0 chart_studio==1.1.0

    pip install plotly==4.14.3 kaleido dash==1.20.0 ^
      dash-html-components==1.1.3 dash-core-components==1.16.0 dash-table==4.11.3 ^
      jupyter-dash==0.4.0 chart_studio==1.1.0
