Install Twine if not already installed, which upload your project to PyPI
* pip install twine

Make sure we have properly prepared the package first ie. we need the following files properly prepared
* setup.py

If we are uploading a new version, make sure to change the version number in setup.py

Be careful to remove dist folder (otherwise later will try to re-upload old files)

Now create a distribution package
* python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

For PyPI test environment upload (strongly recommend doing this first, in case you make a mistake)
* python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

For PyPI prod environment upload
* python -m twine upload dist/*
